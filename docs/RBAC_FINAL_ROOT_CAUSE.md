SAP-grade navigation drift was caused by competing authorization engines (navigationResolver vs rbacResolver/tabSubTab.normalizePermissions) and page-level tab renderers that ignored the resolver output; synthetic permission inference (action→read + verb stripping) treated deep-only grants as parent access while Billing, Console, Users, and Settings rendered hard-coded tabs and performed client-side clamping instead of resolver-driven redirects, so unauthorized tabs appeared in the DOM, triggered a momentary navigation to their query params, and then bounced to the first allowed tab, producing the observed flicker/"clamp" chain.
